# hello-world
my first repository

Hey there, nice to meet you all! 

My name is Steve, I'm fairly new to the programming world, so far I've learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javasricpt. I haven't had the chance to develop my own interactive and amazing websites yet, but really hoping that happens soon.

I decided to jump ships from my previous career and explore the world of programming. This is still all so new to me, but I'm eagerly looing forward to collaborating and working with you all.
